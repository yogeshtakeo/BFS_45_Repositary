                The 8000m Down Suit was designed to withstand the extreme conditions encountered on 8,000m peak 
                expeditions. We use a Pertex® Diamond Fuse ripstop nylon shell; it is tightly woven for durability 
                and boasts a built-in microporous coating to repel precipitation. This down suit is packed with 
                RDS certified 900 fill-power HyperDRY™ Down for ultimate premium lightweight warmth. Thoughtful 
                details, like double chest zippers, keep this down suit highly functional without adding unneeded
                 weight. Bright contrasting designs increase the visibility of the suit, helping you to stay 
                 visible in tough situations. It is truly built for the highest and harshest conditions on Earth.

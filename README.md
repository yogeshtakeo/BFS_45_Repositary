# Basic Website Design

My first basic website using javascript, css, and reactjs.

## Things I learned

<ul>
    <li>Styling components with CSS properties like margin, padding, transition, animation and hovering.</li>
    <li>CSS layout modeling tools like flexbox and its properties like flex-direction, which defines the axis of the flex container (row or column), justify-content, which aligns flex items along the main axis, align-items, which  aligns flex items along the cross axis.</li>
</ul>

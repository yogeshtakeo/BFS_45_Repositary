#Task 4 : React Router with CSS Styling #6

## Things I learned
React Router DOM helps in building multi-page applications (MPAs) by providing a way to manage navigation and rendering different components based on the URL path.

### Some of the features of react-router-dom are:

#### Declarative Routing:
 React Router DOM allows you to define routes using a declarative syntax, which makes it easy to understand and manage the routing structure of your application.
#### Component-Based Routing: 
React Router DOM is designed to work seamlessly with React components. Each route can be associated with a specific component, allowing you to create a modular and component-based architecture for your application.
#### Nested Routing: 
React Router DOM supports nested routing, allowing you to define routes within routes. This enables you to create complex layouts and nested UI structures while maintaining a clean and organized routing configuration.
#### Navigation: 
React Router DOM provides components like <Link> and <NavLink> for navigation between different routes. These components handle URL changes without causing a full page reload, resulting in a smoother and faster user experience.
#### Dynamic Routing: 
React Router DOM supports dynamic routing, allowing you to define routes with dynamic parameters. This enables features like route-based data fetching and dynamic content rendering based on URL parameters.

#### History Management: 
React Router DOM provides a history API that allows you to programmatically navigate between routes, go back and forward in history, and manipulate the browser's URL without causing a full page reload.

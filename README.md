# Box Toggle App

The Box Toggle App is a React web application that allows users to toggle the active state of a series of boxes. The active box is indicated by a blue color. Upon initial load, the first box is active. Pressing the toggle button shifts the active state to the next box in the sequence and the box moves up with a smooth animation. When reaching the last box, clicking the toggle button activates the first box again.
